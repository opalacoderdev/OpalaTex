// Three of them do: `ide`, `studio` and `document`. The chat-first layouts
// (`chat`, `chat-bottom`) put a conversation where the editor would be, and
// `review` puts the checkpoint sidebar there. Two rules read off that one list,
// which is why it lives here rather than being spelled out at each call site:
//
//   - those layouts dock the explorer/source-control sidebar, so opening the
//     explorer from one of them must not switch the user to another layout
//     (`ActivityBar`'s `hasDockedSidebar`);
//   - opening a file only has to leave the layouts that hide the editor
//     (`App.jsx`'s `revealEditorLayout`), so picking a file in the explorer
//     never drops the user out of the studio or the document layout — which,
//     in the document layout, would mean leaving it for the very file it
//     exists to show.

 *
 *   - The studio is a four-surface layout, so it opens with all four on screen
 *     — except the workspace explorer, which starts retracted because the
 *     layout exists to give the document the width. It names its bottom cell
 *     the terminal, so that cell opens on the terminal rather than on whichever
 *     tab was last read there.
 *   - The document layout is two panes and nothing else, the open document and
 *     its preview, so the explorer starts retracted for the same reason. With
 *     no document open there is nothing to give the width to, and the editor's
 *     empty state points at the file tree, so it opens on the explorer instead.
 *   - The review layout replaces the sidebar with its checkpoint list.
