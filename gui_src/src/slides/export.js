// Getting a deck out of OpalaTex, in the three shapes people actually ask for:
//
//   • PPTX  — a real, editable PowerPoint file. Built with PptxGenJS (MIT),
//             entirely in the browser: no server round-trip and no headless
//             browser, which is what keeps this working in the packaged app.
//   • HTML  — one self-contained file that presents in any browser, with the
//             slides inlined as absolutely positioned boxes and arrow-key
//             navigation. No runtime dependency, nothing to install.
//   • PDF   — through the browser's own print-to-PDF, driving a print window
//             whose @page matches the deck aspect exactly.
//
// PptxGenJS is imported lazily. It is the single largest dependency the deck
// editor pulls in, and a user who never exports should never pay for it.
