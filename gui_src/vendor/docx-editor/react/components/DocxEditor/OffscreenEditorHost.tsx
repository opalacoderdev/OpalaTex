/**
 * The body's ProseMirror editor — off-screen, and the only editor there is.
 *
 * This is the half of the dual-rendering model nobody sees. ProseMirror owns
 * everything about *editing*: the document, undo history, the keymap, IME
 * composition, clipboard, selection. It just doesn't own the pixels. Its
 * `EditorView` is mounted 9999px to the left of the viewport, and what the user
 * looks at is a completely separate DOM tree that the painter rebuilds from this
 * view's state.
 *
 * The reason is fidelity. ProseMirror renders through `toDOM`, which produces a
 * flowing HTML document — one long column of text. A Word document is not that:
 * it is a sequence of fixed-size pages with hard breaks, repeated table headers,
 * footnotes pinned to the bottom of the page that references them. You cannot
 * get there from `toDOM`. So the editing model and the presentation are split,
 * and this component is the editing side of the split.
 *
 * Practical consequence, and the one thing to remember: **fixing `toDOM` for a
 * visual bug changes nothing the user can see.** The visible pages come from
 * `painter-model/paintPage.ts`.
 *
 * The host stays focusable — it is off-screen, not hidden. `aria-hidden` would
 * take it out of the accessibility tree, and `display: none` would stop it
 * receiving keys; either one silently breaks screen readers and typing. It is
 * moved, not removed.
