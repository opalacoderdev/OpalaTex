"""Reading annotations stored inside the PDF file itself.

The viewer's annotation tools target **standalone PDFs** -- a paper, a spec, a
reference someone opened in the editor -- not the PDF that ``pdflatex`` regenerates
on every compile. That distinction is what makes writing into the file the right
storage: nothing overwrites it behind the user's back, so the annotations can live
in the place the PDF format already reserves for them instead of in a sidecar only
OpalaTex can read.

Storing them natively makes the format a two-way street. Highlights a user already
made in Zotero, Acrobat or a tablet reader show up here with no import step, and
highlights made here travel back out when the file is shared. A private JSON
sidecar would read nothing and export nothing.

Coordinates cross the wire **normalized to 0..1** against the page box rather than
as PDF points. The viewer knows its own zoom and the browser gives it CSS pixels;
normalizing on that side means the scale factor cancels out before it can be got
wrong. ``Page.rect`` reports the *rotated* box, which is exactly the box pdf.js
lays out, so a normalized value means the same thing on both sides.

PyMuPDF's annotation writers do **not** share that space: they take coordinates in
the page's unrotated space. A normalized rect is therefore mapped through
``Page.derotation_matrix`` on the way in and read back through
``Page.rotation_matrix`` on the way out. Skipping that step puts every mark on a
rotated page in the wrong quadrant, and it fails quietly -- the rect handed back
still looks plausible, so only rendering the page and finding the painted pixels
shows it. That is what the rotation tests check.

Identity is the annotation's PDF cross-reference number (``xref``). Incremental
saves append rather than renumber, so an xref stays valid across later edits and
deletions of other annotations in the same file.
