"""Keep the operating system awake while an agent turn is running.

An agent turn is unattended work: the user starts it and looks away, which is
exactly the situation the idle-sleep timer was written for. When the machine
suspends mid-turn every socket dies with it, so on resume the GUI has lost the
stream of a turn the server still owns and the user is met with the *"An agent
turn is still running, but this window lost its connection to it"* dialog
(`App.jsx`, `utils/agentRunConflict.js`) — being asked to kill work they were
waiting for. The turn-outlives-its-stream contract (PROJECT_DESIGN 2.6) makes
that recoverable rather than fatal, but the suspend itself is what should not
have happened: nothing that runs while the user waits for it should let the
system decide the wait is idleness.

This asks the OS not to *idle*-sleep. It deliberately does not block a sleep the
user asks for (closing the lid, choosing Sleep) and does not keep the display on:
the screen may go dark while the turn keeps running, which is the behaviour a
long compile or download already has.

Inhibition is reference counted, so nested holders (a turn plus a worker
delegation) cannot release each other's hold, and every backend failure is
non-fatal: a machine with no inhibitor available still runs its turns, it just
sleeps as it did before.
