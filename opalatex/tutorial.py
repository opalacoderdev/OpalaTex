"""Built-in usage tutorial for OpalaTex.

The tutorial lives in ``opalatex/guides/tutorial.<lang>.md`` and those files are the
single source of truth: the intro shown as the tutorial chat's first message, the
pre-written answer behind each menu entry, and the guide block injected into the
chat-orchestrator system prompt are all read from them. Nothing here duplicates the
prose into Python constants or into the front-end translation bundles, so the tutorial
cannot drift between the menu and the model's memory.

Guide format: free Markdown up to the first topic heading (the intro), then one section
per topic introduced by::

    ## <topic-id> :: <question shown in the menu>
