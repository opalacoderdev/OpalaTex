"""Locate and install the external command-line tools OpalaTex drives.

Tectonic and pandoc can come from three places, searched in this order:

1. ``<opalatex home>/bin`` — what the user installed from inside the app. It is
   searched first so that reinstalling a tool actually replaces the one in use.
2. A directory shipped with the application (a source checkout's ``bin/``, a
   PyInstaller bundle, or the snap's ``$SNAP/bin``, which is also on ``PATH``).
3. ``PATH``.

Downloads are installed into (1) and never next to the package: the package
directory is read-only in the snap (a squashfs mount) and in system-wide
installs, which is how "Install Pandoc" used to fail with ``[Errno 30]
Read-only file system`` on ``.../site-packages/bin``.
