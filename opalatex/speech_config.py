"""Speech synthesis configuration for OpalaTex.

Global settings persisted at ``<opalatex home>/speech.json``:

    {
        "enabled": false,            # whether "Pronounce" is offered at all
        "engine": "local",           # "local" (downloaded voice) or "remote"
        "local_voice": "",           # key of a voice in the voice store
        "model": "",                 # catalog id of the speech model ("remote")
        "voice": "",                 # "" → the framework default voice
        "response_format": "mp3",    # wire format asked of the provider
        "speed": 1.0,                # playback rate asked of the provider
        "route": ""                  # "" → the model's catalog route, else override
    }

Two engines, one block. ``local`` runs a downloaded Piper voice in this process
(``opalatex/voice_store.py``, route ``local_onnx``) and needs no network, no
account and no endpoint -- it is the default because it is the one that keeps
§2.2's offline promise. ``remote`` speaks the OpenAI ``/v1/audio/speech``
contract through the model catalog, which covers hosted providers *and* a
speech server on localhost.

The model is a normal entry of the global model store, so its credentials and
``api_base`` come from the same place every other model's do. That is what makes
one setting cover OpenAI and Azure *and* a speech server on localhost
(Kokoro-FastAPI, openedai-speech, LocalAI, a Piper wrapper): they differ only in
the catalog entry, so the feature does not have to choose between working
offline and working with a hosted provider.

It ships **disabled**. Even on the local engine, speech needs something the
install does not have yet -- a downloaded voice, and a system espeak-ng to turn
text into phonemes. Defaulting it to on would put a menu item in front of every
user that can only fail, so it is opt-in and says exactly what is missing when
it is not ready (:func:`configuration_problem`).
