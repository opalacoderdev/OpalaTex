"""Chat lifecycle operations shared by the CLI commands and the IDE server.

Clearing a chat is not a UI gesture: it erases the stored conversation, the
orchestrator's saved working memory, the chat's archival entries, and the
measured context occupancy. The `/clear_chat` command and the panel's "Clear
chat" action must produce exactly the same state, so the effects live here once
instead of being reimplemented per entry point.
