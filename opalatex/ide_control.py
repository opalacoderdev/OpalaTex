"""Commands the agent sends to the desktop IDE, and the IDE's answers.

The agent's file and compile tools act on the disk; these act on the *window*:
which tabs are open and which one is focused. The window is the only party that
knows its own state, so a command is a round trip rather than a fire-and-forget
event: `send_ide_command` publishes an `ide_command` event on the turn's stream,
the desktop app carries it out with the same handlers a click uses
(`gui_src/src/utils/ideCommands.js`) and posts the outcome, together with the
resulting tab state, to `/api/opalatex/ide_command_result`, which resolves the
pending future here.

This is not the `input_request` channel (`agent_stdin.request_user_input`):
that one waits for a *person* and may wait a day; this one waits for the
application, which answers in milliseconds or not at all. An unanswered command
therefore fails after a short timeout with a diagnostic -- the window may be
closed or disconnected -- instead of pretending the command took effect.

Only the desktop app answers these commands, so the tools that send them are
withheld from the command-line interface (`prompt_surface.GUI_ONLY_TOOLS`).
