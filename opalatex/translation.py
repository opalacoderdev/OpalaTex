"""Snippet translation used by the PDF viewer's "Translate" context-menu action.

The translation runs through an ephemeral AgenticBlocks ``LLMAgentBlock`` that
answers in **plain text**: the whole useful result is the translated text, so
demanding a JSON envelope around it only adds a way to fail. A model that
translates the excerpt perfectly but replies in prose used to produce no
``structured_output`` at all, and the caller could only report that the result
was not valid -- the translation itself was discarded. Nothing here is
PDF-specific: any caller that has a text snippet and a target language can use it.

The project's user prompt prefix is deliberately **not** applied to this agent.
That prefix is standing instruction for the chat agent -- how to answer the
user -- and this is not a conversation: it is a mechanical transform whose
whole input is the excerpt. ``prepend_user_prompt`` would glue the prefix to
the front of the same user message that carries the excerpt, with no boundary
between them, and the model translated the prefix along with the snippet and
showed it in the popup as the translation. A prefix such as "always answer in
Portuguese" would also fight the requested target language. Nothing about the
translation depends on the project, so the project is not consulted.
