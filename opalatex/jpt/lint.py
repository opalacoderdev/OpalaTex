"""Checking a deck the way a reviewer would, before anyone projects it.

`layout.py` makes a good deck hard to get wrong; this makes a bad one hard to
ship. They are separate on purpose: the linter sees every deck, including the
ones that came through the raw-elements escape hatch, the ones an agent wrote
by hand, and the ones a user has been editing for a week.

Two rules shape what is in here:

  * **A finding names a defect the reader would notice.** Not a style opinion —
    nothing here says a slide should have three bullets rather than four. Text
    that does not fit its box, an element off the edge of the slide, type too
    small to read from the back of a room, grey-on-white nobody can make out:
    those are defects, and they are all this reports.
  * **Errors are things that are wrong, warnings are things that are probably
    wrong.** The distinction is load-bearing, because `create_presentation`
    refuses to write a deck with errors and happily writes one with warnings.
    Anything estimated rather than measured (see `metrics.py`) can only ever be
    a warning unless it is wrong by a wide margin.
