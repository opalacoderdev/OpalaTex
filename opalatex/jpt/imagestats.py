"""Measuring the picture under a piece of text.

The linter cannot judge contrast against a photograph by arithmetic on two
colour values, and for a while it said so and stopped there: any text over any
background picture raised a warning. That is a confident answer to the wrong
question — most slide backgrounds are pale, near-uniform artwork chosen exactly
so text can sit on them, and warning about every one of them teaches the reader
to ignore the linter.

PyMuPDF is a hard dependency of OpalaTex, and the picture is right there, so the
question can simply be measured: what is actually behind *this* text box? Only
where the answer is "something busy" — where the luminance under the box varies
too much for any single ink to be legible over it — is there nothing left to
compute.

The mapping from slide coordinates to picture coordinates follows the same
`fit` the renderer uses, so the region sampled is the region the reader sees.
