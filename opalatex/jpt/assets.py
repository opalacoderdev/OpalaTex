"""Embedding a deck's pictures into the deck.

The editor inlines every picture the user picks or pastes, which is what makes a
`.jpt` one self-contained file that survives being moved, copied to another
machine, or sent to someone. A deck an agent wrote by referencing
`figures/plot.png` looks identical in the app and is not the same thing at all:
move the file and the slide is empty. Two ways of creating the same document
should not differ in whether the result is portable, so the tools embed too.

Two limits, both deliberate and both reported rather than silent:

  * **A picture larger than `MAX_EMBED_BYTES` keeps its path.** Base64 costs a
    third more than the bytes it carries, and a `.jpt` is a document a human
    diffs, a checkpoint stores and the cloud mirror uploads — a 40 MB JSON is a
    worse outcome than a reference. The caller is told which files stayed out.
  * **A picture that cannot be read keeps its path.** A missing figure is
    already an error the linter raises by name; failing the embed step on it
    would report the same problem twice and in a less useful place.
