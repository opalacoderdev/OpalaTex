"""Per-project cloud settings and the sync baseline, stored inside the project.

Everything here lives at ``<project>/.opalatex/cloud/state.json`` and is
**machine-local**: it records this computer's view of what was last synced
(content hashes and remote revisions) plus the user's choices for this project.
It is deliberately excluded from the sync set — uploading it would make two
machines fight over each other's baseline.

The baseline is what makes a real three-way sync possible. Without it the engine
could only see "local differs from remote" and would have to guess a winner;
with it, the engine knows *which side* changed since both agreed.
