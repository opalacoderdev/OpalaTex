"""Walk a project directory and describe what should be mirrored.

Change detection is manifest-based (path + size + mtime + content hash) rather
than built on the shadow git repository in ``.opalatex/.shadowgit``. Two reasons
decided this:

* the shadow repo deliberately ignores LaTeX build output, so it cannot report
  changes to the artifacts this feature is asked to mirror; and
* the VCS strategy is user-configurable and ``NoGitStrategy`` exists, so a
  git-only design would leave those projects unable to sync at all.

Hashing every file on every pass would be wasteful, so the scanner takes the
usual shortcut: when a file's size and mtime match the sync baseline, its
recorded hash is reused and the bytes are never read.
