"""HTTP for the cloud backends, with Happy Eyeballs connection setup.

``urllib`` connects through :func:`socket.create_connection`, which walks the
resolved addresses strictly in order and spends the *whole* socket timeout on
each one before moving to the next. A host that resolves to several addresses
where only some are reachable therefore costs one full timeout per dead address
— and since the Drive backend reads large files, that timeout is necessarily
long (120 s). Observed on a consumer connection with partially broken IPv6
routing to Google: six of the eight ``www.googleapis.com`` AAAA records
blackholed while every A record answered in 40 ms, so the project listing hung
for minutes with no error while browsers and other sync clients on the same
machine were unaffected.

They were unaffected because they implement RFC 8305: interleave the families,
start an attempt every 250 ms, and take the first connection that completes.
This module does the same for the cloud package, and additionally bounds the
*connect* phase separately from the read phase — so a stalled address is
abandoned in seconds while a slow 100 MB download still gets its full timeout.

Only stdlib is used, for the reason given in :mod:`opalatex.cloud.oauth`: a
packaged desktop build should not carry an HTTP stack for a handful of calls.
