"""Orchestration: when a project syncs, and what a sync pass consists of.

The engine reconciles files. This layer decides *when* to run it, keeps one pass
per project at a time, and folds in the parts of a project that are not files —
the conversations exported by :mod:`.chats`.

Scheduling has two triggers, because the backend has no filesystem watcher and
writes arrive from many places (the editor's save endpoint, the agent's file
tools, the LaTeX compiler):

* **debounced local trigger** — callers announce "something changed here" and a
  pass runs once the project has been quiet for `debounce_seconds`. Typing
  produces a burst of writes; syncing each one would spend the provider's rate
  limit to upload a file that changes again a second later.
* **periodic poll** — picks up edits made on another machine, which nothing
  local can announce.

All provider I/O is blocking, so passes run in a worker thread; the asyncio
server that owns the event loop is never blocked by a network round-trip.

    holds the *local* version, so ``keep_remote`` reads the conflict copy rather
    than downloading. Downloading would hand back the very version the user

    Keeping *both* needs no call: that is the state a conflict already leaves
