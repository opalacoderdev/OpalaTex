"""The provider-neutral sync engine.

The engine reconciles three views of the project:

* **local** — what the filesystem holds now (from :mod:`.scanner`);
* **remote** — what the provider lists now;
* **base** — what the two agreed on at the end of the previous sync
  (:class:`~.state.CloudState.entries`).

Comparing all three is what lets the engine tell *which side* changed. A
two-way design without a baseline can only see "these differ" and has to guess a
winner, which is how sync tools silently discard work.

When both sides changed, the engine never merges. It keeps the local file, saves
the remote version beside it as a clearly named conflict copy, and reports the
conflict. Auto-merging LaTeX would produce a file that still compiles while
saying something the author never wrote.
