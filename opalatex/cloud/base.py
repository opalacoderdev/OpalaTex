"""Provider-neutral contract for keeping an OpalaTex project in cloud storage.

The rest of the cloud package talks only to :class:`CloudStorageProvider`. No
Google Drive concept (file ids, ``application/vnd.google-apps`` mime types,
shared drives) may cross this boundary, otherwise a second provider cannot be
added without rewriting the sync engine.

Two rules keep the abstraction honest:

* **Paths are the identity.** Every operation addresses a file by ``rel_path``,
  a POSIX-style path relative to the project root. Providers that key storage
  by opaque ids (Drive) keep their own path -> id map internally; providers
  that are natively path-based (WebDAV, a local folder, S3) use the path as is.
* **Revisions are opaque.** ``remote_rev`` is a provider-defined token that
  changes whenever the remote content changes. The engine only ever compares it
  for equality; it never parses or orders it.
