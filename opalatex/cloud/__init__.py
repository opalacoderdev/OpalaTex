"""Optional mirroring of an OpalaTex project to cloud storage.

The package is provider-neutral by construction: `base` defines the contract,
`engine` reconciles a project against any implementation of it, and
`providers/` holds the backends. Nothing outside `providers/google_drive.py`
knows that Google Drive exists.

Nothing here runs unless the user turns it on for a specific project.
