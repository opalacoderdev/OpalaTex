"""Chromium flags for the embedded QtWebEngine window.

QtWebEngine does not run its GPU service in a child process the way a stand-alone
Chromium does: on Windows the graphics driver is loaded into *this* process, so a
fault in it is a fault in OpalaTex — the window vanishes, the Python interpreter
never gets an exception, and the terminal stays empty (see `crash_report`). The
only defence the application has is to keep the driver out of the process, which
trades smooth compositing for a renderer that cannot take the process down with it.

**Two renderers use the GPU, and turning off one of them is not turning it off.**
``--disable-gpu`` stops *Chromium* from using it: WebGL disappears and the GPU
service logs that it could not create its GLES contexts, which is the expected
signature of the flag working. But Qt composites the web view into the window
through its own scene graph, which on Windows defaults to Direct3D 11 — so the
Intel user-mode driver stayed loaded. Measured on the machine that reported the
crashes (Iris Xe, driver 31.0.101.4502), in an off-screen QWebEngineView that
drew a 2D canvas and asked for WebGL:

=================================================  ==================================================
configuration                                      Intel driver DLLs loaded in the process
=================================================  ==================================================
GPU on                                             igd10um64xe, igd10iumd64, igc64, igdgmm64
``--disable-gpu``                                  igd10um64xe, igd10iumd64, igc64, igdgmm64
``--disable-gpu`` + ``QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software``  igd10um64xe
=================================================  ==================================================

The last row is what `GPU_OFF` now applies: the D3D11 user-mode driver, the shader
compiler (``igc64``) and the GPU memory manager (``igdgmm64``) are no longer
loaded. The one DLL left is pulled in when DXGI enumerates adapters, which
Chromium still does to collect GPU information. All three rows rendered the canvas
correctly. An earlier version of this module applied only the flag, and its claim
that the renderer could no longer take the process down was not true.

That is a real cost, so it is never applied silently: `GPU_OFF` is chosen by the
user, in Settings or through ``OPALATEX_DISABLE_GPU``, and the choice is recorded
in the crash log next to the run it belongs to, which is what makes "did turning
it off help?" an answerable question.

The Linux default is the one exception, and it predates this module: QtWebEngine's
GPU process can abort at startup when Mesa's Zink/EGL layer cannot acquire a DRM
render node, which is a blank window rather than a slow one. Setting the flags
variable by hand still wins there, as it always did.
