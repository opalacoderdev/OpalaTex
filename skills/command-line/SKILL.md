# Command Line Skill

This skill provides the sub-agent with tools to manipulate files and directories securely, restricted to the project directory.

**FINDING FILES (CRITICAL):** Do not guess file locations. If the file path is unknown, use targeted discovery such as `get_project_overview` or `run_command` with `rg --files`. If the orchestrator context already gives the exact file path, line range, or command to run, execute that directly and do not call `get_project_overview` first. As a last resort, if you cannot find the file, stop your turn and use the `send_message` tool to ask the user for the file's location.

## AVAILABLE TOOLS

        get_project_overview,
        read_file,
        read_content_pos,
        write_file,
        write_content_pos,
        replace_content_range,
        run_command,
        run_background_command,
        run_interactive_command,
        search_conversation_history


1. write_file: **Use `write_file` directly to create or overwrite any file.** Do NOT use `command_executor.py` for writing file content — shell quoting breaks with multi-line, HTML, CSS, or JavaScript content.

**CRITICAL: LARGE FILES & TRUNCATION PREVENTION**
If a file is large (more than ~100-200 lines, e.g., large `.tex` files or large code files), do NOT attempt to use `write_file` to write the entire file content, as the LLM output limits will cause the JSON tool call to be cut off mid-response (`[TRUNCATED RESPONSE]`).
Instead:
- Use `replace_content_range` to surgically replace only the specific line ranges that need changes.
- Use `write_content_pos` only when inserting new content before a specific line.
- Or, write a small Python helper script that reads the file, performs the string replacements/modifications programmatically (e.g. read, replace, write), and writes it back, then run it using `run_command`.

```
write_file("<relative_or_absolute_path>", "<full file content>")
```
Examples:
```
write_file("tictactoe.html", "<!DOCTYPE html>...")
write_file("src/utils.js", "function foo() {...}")
```


2. read_file: use read_file for directly access files without shell. For example:
```
read_file("<relative_or_absolute_path>")
```
Examples:
```
read_file("tictactoe.html")
read_file("src/utils.js")
```
Do not use `read_file` on large `.tex`, `.log`, or source files just to locate a section, label, or line range. Use `run_command` with `rg`/`grep`/`nl` or use `read_content_pos` once the line range is known.

3. read_content_pos: use read_content_pos for directly access file content at a specific line range without shell. For example:
```
read_content_pos("<relative_or_absolute_path>", "<start_line>", "<end_line>")
```
Examples:
```
read_content_pos("tictactoe.html", "1", "10")
read_content_pos("src/utils.js", "10", "20")
```

4. write_content_pos: use write_content_pos to insert content before a specific line number without shell. For example:
```
write_content_pos("<relative_or_absolute_path>", "<content>", <line_number>)
```
Examples:
```
write_content_pos("tictactoe.html", "<content>", 1)
write_content_pos("src/utils.js", "<content>", 10)
```

5. replace_content_range: use replace_content_range to replace or delete an inclusive line range without rewriting the whole file. Pass an empty content string to delete the selected lines. For example:
```
replace_content_range("<relative_or_absolute_path>", <start_line>, <end_line>, "<content>")
```
Examples:
```
replace_content_range("tictactoe.html", 1, 10, "<content>")
replace_content_range("src/utils.js", 10, 20, "<content>")
```

6. run_command: use run_command to execute non-interactive shell commands (e.g. build, compile, list, grep, python/pip commands). For example:
```
run_command("<command>")
```
Examples (NON-INTERACTIVE commands only):
```
run_command("python -m pytest")
run_command("pdflatex main.tex")
run_command("uv pip install django")
```
WARNING: Do NOT use `run_command` for commands that require user input (like `npm create`, `npm init`, etc). For those, you MUST use `run_interactive_command`. Do NOT run servers or infinite processes with this tool.

7. run_interactive_command: use this specifically for commands that require human interaction, choices, or input. It will open a popup terminal for the user.
```
run_interactive_command("npm create vite@latest app -- --template react")
run_interactive_command("npm init")
```

8. run_background_command: use this to start long-running servers or background processes (e.g., `npm run dev`) directly in the user's main IDE terminal. It returns immediately and does not block.
```
run_background_command("npm run dev")
run_background_command("python manage.py runserver")
```

9. get_project_overview: use get_project_overview for directly access project tree of files. Try with a minimum depth of 5.
Example:
```
get_project_overview(5)
```
Use this only when the project structure is unknown. Skip it when the task already identifies the target file or provides an explicit command.

10. search_conversation_history: use search_conversation_history for directly search conversation history without shell. For example:
```
search_conversation_history("<keyword>")
```
Examples:
```
search_conversation_history("tictactoe")
search_conversation_history("src")
```


## Available Commands via command_executor.py

Consider using `run_python_script` to call `scripts/command_executor.py`  (insert text at a line, remove files/dirs, create empty directories). The syntax uses subcommands:

```
run_python_script("<command_executor.py_path>", "--project-path <project_path> <subcommand> <args>")
```

**Argument Explanation:**
- `<command_executor.py_path>`: The absolute path to the `command_executor.py` script.
- `<project_path>`: The path to the project root (e.g., `.`).
- `<subcommand> <args>`: The specific action you want to take (e.g., `remove-file`, `create-dir`) followed by its arguments.

**Concrete Examples:**

1. Creating a new directory:
`run_python_script("/home/user/skills/command-line/scripts/command_executor.py", "--project-path . create-dir src/components")`

2. Removing a file:
`run_python_script("/home/user/skills/command-line/scripts/command_executor.py", "--project-path . remove-file temp_debug.log")`

3. Renaming a directory:
`run_python_script("/home/user/skills/command-line/scripts/command_executor.py", "--project-path . rename old_folder new_folder")`

### 1. Insert Text

```
run_python_script("<command_executor.py_path>", "--project-path <project_path> insert-text <relative_file_path> --content-file /tmp/_opalatex_content.txt [--line <line_number>]")
```

For multi-line content, write it first with `write_file` to a temp path, then use `--content-file`.

### 2. Remove File
```
run_python_script("<command_executor.py_path>", "--project-path <project_path> remove-file <relative_file_path>")
```

### 3. Create Directory
```
run_python_script("<command_executor.py_path>", "--project-path <project_path> create-dir <relative_directory_path>")
```

### 4. Remove Directory
```
run_python_script("<command_executor.py_path>", "--project-path <project_path> remove-dir <relative_directory_path>")
```

### 5. Rename / Move File or Directory
```
run_python_script("<command_executor.py_path>", "--project-path <project_path> rename <relative_origin_path> <relative_dest_path>")
```

### 6. Copy File or Directory
```
run_python_script("<command_executor.py_path>", "--project-path <project_path> cp <relative_origin_path> <relative_dest_path>")
```
