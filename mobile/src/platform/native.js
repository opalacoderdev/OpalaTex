 *   Services' AuthorizationClient: the Android OAuth client is matched by
 *   package name and signing certificate, so no client id is in the code.
 * - Secret storage encrypted with a key held in the Android Keystore, for the
 *   model providers' API keys.
 * - Streaming HTTP for model providers. A web view's `fetch` is bound by CORS,
 *   and not every provider allows browser origins; native HTTP is not.
