"""Reasoning written into the content channel must never reach the chat.

A thinking-capable model whose project has thinking turned off still reasons.
With the provider's reasoning channel unused, that reasoning arrives inline in
`delta.content`, and — because the chat template already seeded the opening
`<think>` in the prompt — it is terminated by an orphan `</think>` with no
opening tag. Every splitter used to require a balanced pair, so the whole
reasoning prefix was published as if it were the answer.
