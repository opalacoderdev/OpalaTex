"""The snap's interpreter has to be able to create virtual environments.

``$SNAP/bin`` leads PATH, so ``python`` in the integrated terminal is the app's
own interpreter: a ``venv --copies`` made at build time by the gnome SDK's
``python3``. venv records that interpreter as ``home`` in ``pyvenv.cfg``, and
the SDK is a build-only snap, so ``python -m venv .venv`` linked
``.venv/bin/python`` to a file that does not exist at runtime and failed with
``[Errno 2] No such file or directory``. Once that link is valid, ensurepip
still has to be reachable from the base snap's standard library, with pip's
wheel at the absolute path Debian's ensurepip reads it from.
