"""`create_plan` belongs to plan mode, and an approved plan outlives its dialog.

Two defects observed in one turn (`openrouter/openai/gpt-5.6-luna`, project in
`auto` mode, asked only to *show* a correction plan):

  * The model opened an approval dialog for a plan nobody was going to execute.
    `create_plan` halts the turn on a confirmation, which contradicts `auto`'s own
    contract -- action is pre-authorized there precisely so no dialog appears --
    and its description had always said "in plan mode". Saying so was not enough.
  * The plan itself, 5 817 characters, was presented through a transient
    `input_request` and never persisted. What survived the turn was the model's
    857-character summary of it, so reopening the chat left a summary of a plan
    that could no longer be read: the pointer-shaped answer again, one layer above
    the turn protocol.
