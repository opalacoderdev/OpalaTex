"""The system must not idle-sleep through an agent turn.

Regression for a turn lost to a standby: the machine suspended mid-turn, every
socket died with it, and on resume the window had lost the stream of a turn the
server still owned -- so the user was met with "An agent turn is still running,
but this window lost its connection to it" and offered to kill the work they
were waiting for. The turn surviving its stream is the other half of this
(`tests/test_agent_turn_overlap.py`); this half is not suspending in the first
place.
