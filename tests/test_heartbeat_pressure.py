"""The step budget warns before it runs out.

A turn that reaches `max_heartbeats` is cut off mid-work: the user is shown
work in progress instead of an answer and has to resume the run by hand. Until
now the only signal of how much budget was left was the `[System: You have N
heartbeats remaining.]` tail appended to every tool result, which reads as
bookkeeping and says nothing about what to do with the number.

`heartbeat_pressure_threshold` turns the last stretch of the budget into an
explicit instruction, the same way `memory_pressure_threshold` does for the
context window: past the threshold every request opens with a SYSTEM ALERT
naming the steps left and asking the model to be brief and close the turn. The
alert is transient -- it is appended to the request, never to `internal_history`
-- so the model reads one current warning instead of a pile of stale ones.
