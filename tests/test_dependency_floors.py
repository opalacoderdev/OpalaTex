"""The Qt floor declares what was verified, not what happens to install.

`PyQt6>=6.8.0` was declared for a long time and was false on Windows in two
different ways, both found by installing the older releases while chasing a
graphics crash:

* Qt 6.8.2 embeds Chromium 122. pdf.js 5 calls ``URL.parse`` (Chrome 126), so
  opening a PDF threw and the whole window went grey.
* Qt 6.10.2 ships ``MSVCP140.dll`` 14.26. ``onnxruntime`` needs a newer C++
  runtime and brings none; Qt loads first, its runtime wins for the whole
  process, and the first agent message died importing onnxruntime.

6.11.2 passes both. The ``-Qt6`` packages are the ones that carry the runtime,
so they are held to the verified patch release rather than to PyQt6's own
``>=6.11.0``. Lowering any of these needs the same two checks run again.

The four also share one ceiling. PyQt6-WebEngine pins its own Qt binaries but
not PyQt6-Qt6, so when PyQt6 6.12 was published before PyQt6-WebEngine 6.12,
pip installed 6.12 next to WebEngine 6.11 and the Windows release build failed
to load QtWebEngineWidgets ("The specified procedure could not be found").
