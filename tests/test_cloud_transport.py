"""Happy Eyeballs connection setup for the cloud backends.

The regression these cover: a host whose IPv6 records blackhole while its IPv4
records answer normally. Walking the addresses in resolver order spends the
whole socket timeout on each dead one, which is how the Drive project listing
came to hang for minutes instead of failing or falling back.
