"""Refuse a Linux bundle that only starts on machines with extra packages.

PyInstaller copies a binary's shared-library dependencies from the machine that
runs the build. A dependency that is not installed there is reported with a
"Library not found" warning and the build carries on, so the bundle ships
without it and works only where the user happens to have it. That is how the
release came to need ``apt install libxcb-cursor0`` and friends: Qt's xcb
platform plugin links nine X11 client libraries that the GitHub runner does not
have, and on a desktop without them Qt aborts with "no Qt platform plugin could
be initialized" before the window exists.

This gate runs ``ldd`` on what the application loads to open its window — the
platform plugins, their GL integrations, QtWebEngine and Python — with the
``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` the PyInstaller bootloader sets, and refuses every
dependency that resolves outside the bundle or not at all. The libraries
PyInstaller excludes on purpose (glibc, the GL/EGL/DRM driver stack,
``libxcb.so.1``, Wayland's client libraries) belong to the user's graphics stack
and are allowed to come from the system; the gate asks PyInstaller itself which
those are rather than keeping a copy of its list.

Exit codes: 0 when every dependency is bundled or host-provided, 1 otherwise.
